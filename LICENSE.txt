COPYRIGHT / END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT by SLY TECHNOLOGIES
                Version 1.0, January 2023
        http://www.slytechs.com/free-license-txt

jNetWorks, jNetPcap Pro, jNapatech, jDpdk, all Protocol Packs and 
supporting modules (the "Software"), are a modular network analysis 
and protocol emulation library which are copyright (c) 2015-2023 by 
Sly Technologies Inc ("Sly Technologies"). All rights reserved.

Even though the Software source code is publicly available for review, it is
not open source software and may not be redistributed or used in other
software without special permission from Sly Technologies.  The
standard (free) version is usually limited to installation on five
systems. We fund our projects by selling two types of commercial
licenses to a special Software OEM edition:

1) The Software OEM Redistribution License allows companies distribute
the Software within their products. Licensees may choose between a perpetual 
unlimited license or a quarterly term license, along with options for 
commercial support and updates. 
Prices and details: https://slytechs.com/oem-redistribution-license

2) The Software OEM Internal-Use License is for organizations that wish
to use the Software OEM internally, without redistribution outside their
organization. This allows them to bypass the 5-system usage cap of the
the free Software edition. It includes commercial support and update options,
and provides extra Software OEM features. 
Prices and details: https://www.slytechs.com/oem-internal-use-license

Both of these licenses include updates and support as well as a
warranty. Further details about the Software OEM are available from
https://www.slytechs.com/oem-redistribution-license, and you are also 
welcome to contact us at sales@slytechs.com to ask any questions or 
set up a license for your organization.

If Sly Technologies (directly or through one of our commercial
licensing customers) has granted you additional rights to the Software, 
those additional rights take precedence where they conflict
with the terms of this license agreement.

Since the the Software source code is available for download and review,
users sometimes contribute code patches to fix bugs or add new
features.  By sending these changes to Sly Technologies (including
through direct email or our mailing lists or submitting pull requests
through our source code repository), it is understood unless you
specify otherwise that you are offering Sly Technologies the
unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense your
code contribution so that we may (but are not obligated to)
incorporate it into the Software.  If you wish to specify special license
conditions or restrictions on your contributions, just say so when you
send them.

This copy of the Software and accompanying documentation is
licensed and not sold. This Software is protected by copyright laws
and treaties, as well as laws and treaties related to other forms of
intellectual property. The Sly Technologies owns intellectual property
rights in the Software.  The Licensee's ("you" or "your") license to
download, use, copy, or change the Software is subject to these rights
and to all the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement
("Agreement").

This Agreement entitles you to install and use five (5) copies of the

only have one instance of this Agreement active at once.  For example,
downloading the software multiple times, downloading multiple versions
of the software, and/or executing the software installer multiple
times do not grant any additional rights such as using the software on
more machines.

The terms "computer" and "machine" in this license include any
computing device, including software computing instances such as
virtual machines and Docker containers.

by this free license or benefit from commercial support and features

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE ATTRIBUTION

The Software uses several 3rd party open source software libraries:

* The libpcap portable packet capturing library from https://tcpdump.org
* The Winpcap packet capturing library. It has been abandoned, but is
  currently still available from https://www.winpcap.org/.
* The ieee80211_radiotap.h header file from David Young
* The Napatech Software Suite for Napatech SmartNIC adapters from 
  http://napatech.com 

All of these are licensed under the terms specified by each third party. 
Some include a warranty disclaimer (relating to the original authors) 
and require a small amount of acknowledgment text be added somewhere 
in the documentation of any software which includes them (including 
indirect inclusion through the Software).

Only certain Software modules utilize any of these third party software
libraries, other Software modules do not. For example "jNetPcap Pro" 
software module, does not utilize any part of the Napatech libraries.
The "core-protocols" software module does not use any third party 
libraries at all. For details on third party Software usage by each 
Software module, please see the file "THIRD-PARTY.txt" included with 
each Software module.

The required acknowledgement text as well as full license text and
source details for these libraries is available from:
https://slytechs.com/this-party-open-source .

Since Sly Technologies Inc is not the author of this 3rd party code, we
can not waive or modify its software copyright or license.  The Software
users and redistributors must comply with the relevant the Software license
(either the free/demo license or a commercial the Software OEM license they
may have purchased) as well as the minimal requirements of this 3rd
party open source software.
